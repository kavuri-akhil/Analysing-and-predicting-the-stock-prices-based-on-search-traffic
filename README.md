# Analysing-and-predicting-the-stock-prices-based-on-search-traffic
##Background of the project
I am working as growth analyst at MercadoLibre to an external site. With over 200 million users, MercadoLibre is the most popular e-commerce site in Latin America. I have been tasked with analysing the company's financial and user data in clever ways to help the company grow. So, I want to find out if the ability to predict search traffic can translate into the ability to successfully trade the stock.
